Application Constructs
======================

This is the second level (**Level 2**) of abstract constructs.
Both Level 0 and Level 1 constructs are composed to create Level 2 constructs.

These constructs are meant to specialize to user-specific use case.
This library may provide some essential application constructs, but users are
encouraged to follow this design philosophy in their own implementations.
You can :ref:`create your own construct <custom constructs>` to take advantage
of the features of this library.
